### Project goal:
##### Tennis matches prediction service back-end implementation.

### Objectives:
##### 1) Implement robust and reusable **data preprocessing** module;
##### 2) Teach ML-models for matches **prediction** (and choose the one that performs best);
##### 3) Implement **data parsing** module for future matches prediction.

---

##### The first PoC-implementation had been written in the not the most educational environment (army): 
Galaxy J1 + SSH + VDS, linux terminal - nano.

---

##### There is a 'jupyter_notebooks' folder where I plan to describe the design process:
- Series 1 is dedicated to the first implementation which had been made during the army service;
- Series 2 will reflect the application of the new (and actually basic for Data Scientist) skills gained.
